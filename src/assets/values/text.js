      "If you are interested in this theme, we highly recommend attending the Ericsson 5G & IoT Bootcamp on May 8th and 9th (completely free), which is a mini-Hackathon with learning and hands-on development. The only knowledge you need to attend this Hackathon is knowing how to program (any programming language works!). Ericsson will provide a mix of keynotes, demos, ask the experts and networking during the event. On top of this there will be experts covering all areas in the end-to-end IoT space, coaches and you will have the opportunity to meet representatives from MobilityXlab. So, you can start your Hack at the Bootcamp, and continue it at the C&SE Hackathon. Important: The bootcamp and the C&SE Hackathon are two separate events, so make sure you register in both places. Ericsson practitioners from the bootcamp will be coaches at the C&SE Hack and keep an eye for students participating in both events."

Your ideas should address challenges faced by several organizations such as the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket), UNICEF, the Swedish Employment Agency (Arbetsf√∂rmedlingen), etc. We will offer a set of challenges listed by such organizations that you can work with your team to solve. The idea can also be continued in the OpenHack Gothenburg event between May 24 - 26."

      question: "Any advice?",
      answer:
        "There is no I in TEAM. So, remember to build a good team with a variety of expertise so everyone can share and learn from one another. Being friendly (not FRIENDS) is essencial for collaboration in a Hackathon. Especially among different teams. Remember, everyone is in the same boat: sink or swim. Delegating tasks is important. Explore everyone's unique capabilities: Divide and conquer! Try to assign different responsibilities, for instance: <ul><li>Above all: Be fun, creative and learn lots of new stuff (technical and personal)</li><li>Using tools (git, APIs, etc.) properly, track time and goals, talk with organization</li><li>Pitching the idea (slides, catch phrases), designing the interface Dev</li><li>Coding: Front-end, back-end, ripping data from websites</li></ul>"
