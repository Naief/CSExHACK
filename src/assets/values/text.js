      "If you are interested in this theme, we highly recommend attending the Ericsson 5G & IoT Bootcamp on May 8th and 9th (completely free), which is a mini-Hackathon with learning and hands-on development. The only knowledge you need to attend this Hackathon is knowing how to program (any programming language works!). Ericsson will provide a mix of keynotes, demos, ask the experts and networking during the event. On top of this there will be experts covering all areas in the end-to-end IoT space, coaches and you will have the opportunity to meet representatives from MobilityXlab. So, you can start your Hack at the Bootcamp, and continue it at the C&SE Hackathon. Important: The bootcamp and the C&SE Hackathon are two separate events, so make sure you register in both places. Ericsson practitioners from the bootcamp will be coaches at the C&SE Hack and keep an eye for students participating in both events."

      "Openhack is a non-profit social company focusing on how Open Source can be used to solve humanitarian challenges. Your ideas should address challenges faced by several organizations such as the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket), UNICEF, the Swedish Employment Agency (Arbetsförmedlingen), etc. We will offer a set of challenges listed by such organizations that you can work with your team to solve. The idea can also be continued in the OpenHack Gothenburg event between May 24 - 26."
